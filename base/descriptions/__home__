This website provides access to the historic IRC logs of the development
of the RakuÂ® Programming Language.  They are provided here as complete
as possible, either from
<a href="https://colabti.org/irclogger//irclogger_logs">historic logs</a>
or from the new <a href="https://github.com/Raku/IRC-logs">Raku IRC logs</a>.

Due to the nature of IRC, there can be no guarantee that these logs are
by any means complete: network issues can cause an IRC logger to lose
connection with the IRC server, while people are still chatting on an
IRCchannel.  However, considerable efforts have been made to fill any
gaps in the historical record.

Please enjoy the history of Raku, or check out current development on
the live pages of the channels that are active.
