Welcome to the home of the Raku® Programming Language IRC logs!

<div class="subtitle">
This website provides access to the historic IRC logs of the development
of the Raku® Programming Language.  They are provided here as complete
as possible, but there is no guarantee that these logs are by any means
complete: network issues can cause an IRC logger to lose connection
with the IRC server, while people are still chatting on a channel. Thus
losing parts of the conversation, at least as seen by some people on a
channel.

Please enjoy the history of Raku, or just check out current development
on the live pages of the channels that are active.
