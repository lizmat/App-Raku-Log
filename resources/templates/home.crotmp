  <h1>Welcome to the home of the Raku Programming Language IRC logs</h1>
  <p>
This website provides access to the historic IRC logs of the development of
the <a href="https://raku.org">Raku Programming Language</a> (n√©e Perl 6).
They are provided here as complete as possible, but there is no guarantee
that these logs are by any means complete: network issues can cause an IRC
logger to lose connection with the IRC server, while people are still chatting
on a channel.  Thus losing parts of the conversation, at least as seen by some
people on a channel.
  </p>
  <p>
The following logs are currently available (in alphabetical order):

    <p><form action="/<.name>/search.html">Search: <input name="query"/></form></p>
